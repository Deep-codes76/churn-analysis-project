Customer Churn Analysis – Project Summary

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn — i.e., when and why customers stop using a company's service. The goal is to help businesses reduce churn by understanding patterns and identifying high-risk customers in advance.

ETL Process: Data was cleaned and loaded using SQL Server to make it analysis-ready.

Data Visualization: Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards showing key metrics like churn rate, customer demographics, and usage trends.

Churn Prediction: Python (Jupyter Notebook) was used to build a Random Forest model, which helps predict whether a customer is likely to churn.

Insights & Impact: Factors like account tenure, usage frequency, and service complaints were major contributors to churn. These insights can be used to take proactive actions and improve customer retention.
